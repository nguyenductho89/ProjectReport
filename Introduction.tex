\subsection{Introduce to clustering}

\forceindent Cluster analysis or clustering is a very important technology in Data Mining. It divides the datasets into clusters which are collections of data objects with common characteristics based on the computation of data information.

Clustering problems come up in many different applications consisting data mining and knowledge discovery, data compression and vector quantization, and pattern recognition and pattern classification. There are several commonly used clustering algorithms, such as K-means, CLARANS, STING, CLIQUE, and CURE.  %Them trich dan cac ung dung
