\section{Non-parametric: Meanshift}

\subsection{What?}

Mean shift  is a popular non-parametric clustering algorithm based on the
idea of associating each data point to a mode of the underlying probability density
function\textsuperscript{2.1}.{\linebreak}

Assuming that we have a dataset of students and corresponding mark for each of them 
in final exam as the table below. How do we categorize these students into groups base on their marks?
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c||} 
 \hline
 No & Student & Mark \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 1 & S1 & 5.0 \\ 
 \hline
 2 & S2 & 4.0 \\
 \hline
 3 & S3 & 4.5 \\
 \hline
 4 & S4 & 5.7 \\
 \hline
 5 & S5 & 6.0 \\ 
  \hline
 6 & S6 & 9.0 \\ 
  \hline
 7 & S7 & 8.7 \\ 
  \hline
 8 & S8 & 9.5 \\ 
 [1ex] 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Meanshift is a powerful tool for us in this case although the idea behind it is very simple.
Imagine that the set of marks was sampled from a probability distribution. Meanshift seeks for modes of  the underlying distribution for this set of marks. Number of modes corresponds to the number of groups of students.

As can be seen from the graph above, we have two groups of students correspond to two modes of probability distribution function. 
With Mode 1, we have first group which includes: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5.  Similarly, correspoding to Mode 2 is second group, which includes : S6, S7, S8.
